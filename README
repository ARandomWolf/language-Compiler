Project written in python version 2.7.5

The scanner portion of this project takes file or console input.
Important: typed console input (not redirect) requires the EOF to be on a new line.
This is because all data in the line buffer is cleared on receipt of EOF.

This program outputs a list of tokens one at a time, giving details on each one.

How to run program
option 1 (input entered by user):
        python main.py

        Note: CTRL-D or CTRL-Z (EOF) must be entered on new line.
        All text present on the same line as the EOF token will be lost.

option 2 (using file input): python main.py filename

option 3 (redirect): python main.py < filename
